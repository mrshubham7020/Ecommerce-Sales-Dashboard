# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard
In this project, we have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse sales data

We used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers

Then we created new connections, joined tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualization

The data is plotted using different types of customized visualizations(bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.)

Here is the dashboard
